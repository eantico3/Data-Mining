# Data-Mining

These files are smaller projects that supplied all the tools needed for our final Data Mining project. In this final project, my team and I will be creating a Quarterback rating system using a dataset containing every regular season NFL game and every NFL passer from 1996 to 2016.

This final project will be added to this repository upon completion.
